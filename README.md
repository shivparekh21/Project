PROJECTS
Historical Hurricane Data Analysis and Visualization                                              
•	Led comprehensive analysis and visualization initiative focusing on historical hurricane data spanning from 1851 to 2021. 
•	Employed Python programming skills to process, clean, and organize raw hurricane data. 
•	Established and managed a MongoDB database, utilizing PyMongo for seamless data storage and retrieval.
•	Conducted in-depth data analysis using PyMongo queries to extract key insights into storm characteristics, including intensity, trajectory, and frequency. 
•	Leveraged Geopandas and matplotlib libraries to create interactive visualizations, effectively depicting storm paths over North America. 
•	Contributed to improved understanding of historical meteorological trends and their impact on the region, facilitating informed decision-making processes.


Network Analysis of Software Repositories: Identifying Subject Matter Experts
•	Developed Python tool for analyzing Git logs to reveal collaboration patterns in software development teams.
•	Utilized libraries like csv, networkx, and matplotlib for data processing and visualization. 
•	Constructed bipartite graphs to visualize connections between authors and modified files. 
•	Conducted analyses including total files modified by each author and identification of authors with similar file updates. 
•	Applied advanced techniques such as eigenvector centrality and community detection algorithms on bipartite graphs. 
•	Provided actionable insights to optimize collaboration and project efficiency.


Real Estate Market Analysis and Prediction Project
•	Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create insightful visualizations, including bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps. 
•	Conducted comprehensive analysis of real estate market trends using Python. 
•	Developed predictive models utilizing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and random forest regression. 
•	Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
•	Achieved high accuracy with the predictive models, demonstrating strong performance in forecasting future real estate prices. 
•	Leveraged visualizations to effectively communicate findings and facilitate stakeholder engagement. 
•	Forecasted future real estate prices to provide actionable insights for decision-making processes.
